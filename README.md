# pong-js
A simple Javascript game of Pong.

## Motivation
To teach myself how to create games and how to create games in Javascript.

## Resources
To start, I am using the 'Pong Clone In Javascript' by Matt Mongeau (https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript) as a base to help myself understand Javascript better before I play around with it.
