# pong-js
A simple JavaScript game of Pong.

## Motivation
To teach myself how to create games and how to create games in JavaScript.

## Resources
To start, I am using the [Pong Clone In Javascript](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/pong-clone-in-javascript) by Matt Mongeau as a base to help myself understand Javascript better before I play around with it.
